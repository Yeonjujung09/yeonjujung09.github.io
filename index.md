## Selected projects with SQL, Python, and Tableau

### Payment Table Creation with SQL
In this project, I designed and implemented a new payments table by combining and manipulating two existing tables. The resulting table tracks the amounts paid by each customer, providing a streamlined and efficient way to analyze payment data.

### Retention & Revenue Analysis with SQL
In this project, I created a comprehensive table that tracks key metrics such as retention rate, paid user ratio, and ARPPU (Average Revenue per Paid User). The resulting table helps analyze user behavior and revenue trends, providing valuable insights to support data-driven decisions for business growth.

### RFM Analysis with Python
In this project, I use RFM analysis, a marketing technique that segments customers based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. This segmentation enables marketing teams to customize messages and campaigns for each group, ultimately boosting customer engagement and driving sales.
